Architecture:
1. L2                                                — Acc: 0.7, overfitting
2. L1L2                                              — Acc: 0.7, overfitting
3. L1L2, Dropout                                     — Acc: 0.7 overfitting
4. L1L2, Dropout, model reduction                    — Acc: 0.7 less overfitting
5. L1L2, more Dropout, model reduction               — Acc: 0.7 even less overfitting
Augmentation on model 5
1. Rotation 0.3 — Acc: 0.5  no overfitting
2. Flip         — Acc: 0.6  no overfitting
3. Translation  — Acc: 0.55 a bit overfitting
4. Zoom         — Acc: 0.7  no overfitting
5. Contrast     — Acc: 0.7  no overfitting
6- All above    — Acc: 0.6 no overfitting
WideResNet 28-10:
1. Acc: 0.85 some overfitting
